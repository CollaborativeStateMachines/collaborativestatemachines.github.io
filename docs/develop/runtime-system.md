**Cirrina** is the official runtime system of the CSM project. Together with the CSM programming model, it is
being developed by the [Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of
Innsbruck.

The runtime system is implemented in **Java** and **Kotlin** and is available as an **open-source project** on [GitHub +octicon:mark-github-24+](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina).

### Key Features

- **High-performance reference implementation** of a CSM runtime system.
- Designed for **heterogeneous environments**: cloud, edge, and IoT devices.
- Supports a **wide range of distributed computing scenarios**.
- Serves as a foundation for research on the **CSM method**.
- Provides a platform that can be **extended, adapted, and evaluated** by the wider community.

### Get Involved

We welcome contributions from **researchers, practitioners, and developers** interested in distributed
systems, programming models, and runtime technologies.
