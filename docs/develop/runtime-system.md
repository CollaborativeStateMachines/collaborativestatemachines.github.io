Cirrina is the official runtime system of the CSM project. Together with the CSM programming model, it is 
being developed by the [Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of 
Innsbruck.  

The runtime system is implemented in Java and Kotlin and is available as an open-source project on [Github
+octicon:mark-github-24+](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina).  

Cirrina acts as a high-performance reference implementation of a CSM runtime system. It is designed to operate
across heterogeneous environments, including cloud, edge, and IoT devices, making it suitable for a wide range
of distributed computing scenarios. In addition to serving as a foundation for our research on the development
of the CSM method, Cirrina provides a platform that can be extended, adapted, and evaluated by the wider 
community.  

We welcome contributions from researchers, practitioners, and developers interested in distributed systems, 
programming models, and runtime technologies. For guidelines on how to get involved, please refer to the 
[contributing](contributing.md) page.
