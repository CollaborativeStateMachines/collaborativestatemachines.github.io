**Cirrina** is the official **runtime system** of the CSM project.

Together with the CSM programming model, it is developed by the 
[Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of Innsbruck.

The runtime system is implemented in **Java** ☕ and **Kotlin** 💜 and is available as an 
**open-source project** on [GitHub](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina).
