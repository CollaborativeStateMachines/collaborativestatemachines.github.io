Version 3.0

These are the Collaborative State Machine language specifications.

These specifications describe the CSM Language (CSML), its syntax, semantics, and execution model. They define
how state machines are constructed, how they interact in a collaborative environment, and the rules governing
state transitions, events, and inter-state machine communication. Additionally, these specifications provide
guidance for implementing CSML-compliant interpreters, compilers, and runtime environments, ensuring 
consistent behavior across different platforms and use cases.
