The CSM project provides several example use cases of the Cirrina runtime system, implemented in the
Pkl CSML language. For a detailed introduction to programming CSM-based applications, see our 
[Tutorial](tutorial.md).

## Example Use Cases

- [Railway Safety System](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina-Examples/tree/develop/railway-crossing):  
  A railway crossing controlled by four collaborating state machines that coordinate gates, signals, 
  and train detection to ensure safety.
