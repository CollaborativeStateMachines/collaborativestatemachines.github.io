Contributions to the CSM project are highly welcome. There are several ways you can get involved, whether by 
improving the runtime system, advancing research, or supporting related tools and documentation.

### Where to start contributing

- **Cirrina Runtime System**  
  The official runtime system for CSM is available as an open-source project on [GitHub 
  +octicon:mark-github-24+](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina). Contributions to Cirrina
  can include bug fixes, feature implementations, performance improvements, or enhancing documentation.

- **Research**  
  If you use CSM in your research, or build upon publications related to the project, your insights and 
  contributions are valuable. Relevant publications can be found [here](../research/publications.md).

- **Documentation and Tutorials**  
  Improving tutorials, examples, or reference documentation is another way to support the project and make 
  CSM more accessible to new users.

### Contributing to Cirrina

Cirrina is implemented in Java and Kotlin, with Kotlin being the preferred language. Contributions can be
submitted via pull requests from forks of the repository.

To ensure smooth collaboration:  

- Follow [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) conventions to keep the changelog 
  tidy.
- Maintain and improve test coverage through our [unit tests](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina/tree/develop/src/test/java/at/ac/uibk/dps/cirrina).
  These are automatically validated via our [build pipeline](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina/blob/develop/.github/workflows/build.yml).
- Pull requests must pass all status checks and undergo code review before merging.  

We encourage contributors to discuss major changes or new features via 
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/CollaborativeStateMachines/Cirrina/issues) before implementation to align
with the project roadmap.

Additionally, for broader discussions related to the CSM project, we have a 
[discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/CollaborativeStateMachines/discussions).
